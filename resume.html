    <p><h3>I did my lower grades in Eastern Cape then came to Cape Town for my high school grades.
     I passed my Matric in 2019 then went to False Bay College because my results were not so good to qualify for IT at 
     a university standard. I did Information Technology And Computer Science NCV Level 2 in 2020 and finished NCV Level 4 in 2022. After that I got an opportunity to be part of an NSF program that was offered at Northlink College, it was a one year contract learnership and I completed my A+ and N+ national qualification in 6 months then got placed at Northlink College for work experience for 6 months.

      <h5>In the short amount of time I've known Olwethu, I've seen how smart, hardworking, funny as well as playful she is. 
        Olwethu has a way of charming people, she makes you feel at peace with her presence and can be quite a comforting person.
        It's been a pleasure knowing her and still getting to know her. She has grown so much since the first day of us learning 
        and I'm excited to see how much she will still grow. Her hardwork and dedication towards coding always amazes me because she 
        never gives up even when she hits a wall, she overcomes that challenge and continues moving on with a smile on her face. </h5></div>
